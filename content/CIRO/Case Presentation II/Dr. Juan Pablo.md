# Osteoporosis 
presented by: Dr. Firas

10/20 - World Osteoporosis Day 

Definition: is one of the most frequent forms of bone diseases that develops when the bone density and mineral decrease, increasing risk of fractures 

Etiology and Pathophysiology:
Lack of calcium and abnormal activity of osteoclasts (more osteoclastic activity than osteoblastic activity)

Osteoblast-osteoclast interaction 
- both cell to cell and chemical interactions 

Risk factors 
1- uncontrolled factors 
- female
- >45 years
- caucasion or asian race 
- thin and small body frame 

2. controlled factors 
- lack of exercise 
- cigarette smoking
- alcohol consumption 
- diet low in calcium 

Classification:
primary osteoporosis:
subtype 1: postmenopausal 
subtype 2: senile osteoporosis 

secondary [[Osteoporosis]] 
- prolonged use of medications or secondary to another disease 
	- endocrine origin, hyperthyrodidism, diabetes, 

Osteopenia 
- initial stage of bone loss, progresses to osteoporosis if not treated 
- does. not require medication; change of lifestyle, vitamin D and calcium 

Osteomalacia 
- bones becomes soft because they don't have enough calcium and phosphorus. usually caused by not having enough vitamin D in the diet 

Diagnosis (osteoporosis)
- diagnosis is BMD (bone mineral density test 
- T-score - different between the value of the xray to 0, which is the bone mineral density of a healthy young adult (age 20-35)
- -1 or higher = healthy bone 
- -1 to -2.5 = osteopenia 
- -2.5 or lower = osteoporosis 
- Z-score - difference between the bone mineral density we get through the test and 0, which is the boneg mineral density of a healthy person of the same age, gender and race 
- a negative Z-score of -2.5 or less should raise suspicion of a secondary cause of osteoporosis 

T- score is more reliable 
- related to bone strength 
- related to fracture risk 

Epidemiology 
- osteopenia affects one in 2 women and 1:4 men over the age of 50 worldwide; most common in non-hispanic and asian women 
- affects 10 million people over the atge of 45 years are diagnosed with osteoporosis 

Clinical manifestations
called "silent disease" until a bone is broken. 
loss of height (as much as 6 inchest or 15 centimeters)
- can develop to a stooped or hunched posture (kyphosis) - medical term for a dowager's hump - hump at base of neck 

Shortness of breath: smaller lung capacity due to compressed disks 
decreased calcitonin: inhibits bone resorption and promotes bone formation, is decreased decreased estrogen, inhibits bone breakdown, decreases with aging
increased parathryoid hormone: PTH increases with aging, increasing bone turnover 

Effect of Osteoporosis on Oral Health 
- tooth loss

Differential Diagnosis
Osteonecrosis (bisphosphonate)
osteoradionecrosis (radiation therapy)
osteomyelitis (staphylococcus aurerus)

Dx:
1. xray
2. MRI - earlier detection
3. CT scan - predicted risk of fracture

# asthma 
- bronchi / bronchioles covered by mucous membranes
- in people with asthma exposed to certain triggers, the asthma attack causes bronchoconstriction and increased production of mucous, blocking the airways 
- it is difficult to breath OUT; CO2 gets trapped inside the body
- prevention: knowing the triggers and avoiding them, inhalers

incidence:
in kids: boys > girls
in adults: girls > boys 

long term:
- bronchodilaters
- - adrenergic agonist
- anticholinergic
- theophylline

pharmacological considerations:
- avoid NSAIDs and acetylsalicylic acid - can trigger asthma symptoms 
- Barbituartes not recommended > can cause bronchospasm 
- theophylline interacts with erythromycin and inc. level of theophjylline 
- the preservative sodium metabisulfite in local anesthetics can exacerbate asthma 
- adrenaline and B2 agonist (salbutamol) - causes synergy; so if you give LA and they experience symptoms of tachycardia right after dont give the inhaler right away; just calm the patient down 

# Hyperthyroidism 
Primary:
- graves' disease 
- toxic adenoma, toxic multinodular goiter or Plummer's disease  
- functioning thyroid carcinoma 
Secondary:

Hyperthyroidism  - Low T4 high 

Complications:
1) Goiter 
2) Eye
3) Skin patches 

Graves' Disease Treatment 
1) Thionamides (mainly methimazole)
2) Radioactive iodine
3) Surgery 

Cancer 
Dental Management:
check for radio therapy = osteoradionecrosis 

Mucositis: help patients with pain 
1) philadelphia solution : (Difenhidramina + caolin-pectina + lidocaina)
2) mouthrinse with antiseptic 

> [!faq] Most common
> Lateral border of tongue: most common site of cancer in the oral cavity 


Pierr-Robbins syndrome 
Emergency: take tongue out of mouth and open airways

Dental Malformation 

Dentinogenesis 
- etiology: genetic; mutation in gene for Type 1 [[Collagen Fiber]] 
- primary teeth: 14th week of fetal development
- permanent teeth: 3 months old 
- by odontoblasts; outside to inwards; begins with mantle dentin 
- odontoblasts secrete predentin, fibroblasts make korff's fibers - thick collagen fibers 
- odontoblasts and fibroblasts grow towards the center of the tooth by growing a protrusion (odontogenic processes) that secrete calcium hydroxyapatite
- Mantle dentin 
- after mantle dentin, odontoblasts continue building primary dentin 
primary dentin - more mineral content, less collagen; thickest layer 
Secondary dentin - resembles primary dentin but forms after root formation; occurs at slow rate and throughout life eto maintain the tooth strength 
Predentin - borders pulp; a layer of organic matrix that hasn't been mineralized; once mineralized become secondary dentin 
Dentin continunes growing regenerating and repairing itself; 
Tertiary dentin - made by odontoblasts who move to the site of injury and produce this band-aid like dentin

Dentinogenesis imperfecta

Clinical exam: teeth appear amber, brown/blue, or opalescent brown , blue sclera
radiographically: crown is bulbous due to constricted DEJ; , small or obliterated pulp chambers, narrrow roots 

DD:
amelogenesis imperfecta
etc.
*
*
*

Type II - has greater pulpal tissue due to greater pulpal tissue; high frequency of pulp exposure

Amelogenesis Imperfecta
- genetic 

Type 1: 
typ II : hypomature AI
type III: hypomineralized amelgonesis imperfecta

Fluorisis 
Trendley Dean - Code 1-5

Fluoride Supplements 
0.7mg/L optimal amount of flouoride in water 
Antivet - enamel microabrasion 

Prevention: 
Salamanca 
Salcatecas
San Luis Potosi 
Jalisco 

Hypoplasia - enamel deficient in quantity 
acquired - bacteria, virus, fever, etc 
Hereditary causes: 
enamel hypoplasia

fluoxy lil - 
MI paste - flouride varnish treatment; for patients with allergic to the protein you can use the other kind 
Treatment: for hypoplastic teeth: sealants, glass ionomer, or dental crowns (SSC or otherwise)

Hypomineralization 
- decrease in quality of enamel 

Duraphat - fluoride varnish 
ikon 

Gardner's syndrome
Prevention, Shock Therapy: alternate seessions with chlorhexidine varnish and fluoride varnish 4 times 

# Hepatitis 

- very aggressive in babies so vaccination is important 

Medications: pegylated interferon and ribavirin 200mg are specific to Hepatitis C (both or one?... check later)

Anomalies of teeth shape and size
Gemination & fusion
- most frequent dvelopmental anomalies in primary dentition 
- fusion - union between the anemel or both dentin and enamel 
- gemination - comes from single tooth bud then divides
- affects primary more than permanent teeth 
- affects anterior mostly; rare in posterior 

Dens in dente 
incidence: most common in permanent maxillary lateral incisors

Taurodontism
- failure of hertwig's epithelial rooth sheath to...

Epstein Pearls 
- small, harmless white or yellow nodules that may appear along your newborn baby's gums or on the roof of their mouth 
- made of keratin
