Syphilis

**hutchinson's triad - malformed teethm (notched incisors, mulberry molars), 8th nerve deafness, interstitial keratitis**

Pregnancy 
HCG
progesterone - respiratory stimulant (short of breath)
erythropoeitin - makes RBC
extra water and salt - blood volume increases by 50%
heart works harder
baby might press on blood vessels, if it presses on inferior vena cava, can make mother suddenly feel dizzy 

average # of days of pregnancy: 280 days; 37-38 early term; 39-40 full term; 41-42 late term

development:
month 1 - blastocyst secretes HCG; neural plate - folds onto itself to form neural tube by month 2; folic acid is a b vitamin that helps form the nueral tube; 78% reduction if you take 400-600 mg of folic acid before pregnancy;
month 2: buds form that are for the limbs; month 3 there are hands and feet with thin skin that you can see blood vessels; 
month 3: 1 oz = 28g; 4 inches = cm; 
month 4-6 = has lanugo/tiny hairs; senses develop like smell, eyes, taste, ears, etc; increase in movement; can reveal baby's sex
month 7-9; lungs are functional; 0.5lbs per week 

1st timester:
fatigue
nausea
vomit
mammary gland enlargement
orally: pyogenic granulomas, gingivitis and periodontitis 

2nd trimester
- feeling of well-being
- psychological preparation for motherhood
- abdominal space and mammary gland grown
- gain 15lbs 
- rhinitis of pregnancy - higher levels of estrogen make mucous membranes swell *careful of cold medications because some are not safe*
- do not sleep on back b/c you might compress the inferior vena cava
- need a thick pillow between legs and on left side

3rd trimester 
-sciatic nerve pain - when baby compresses sciatic nerve; feel it from your bum through back of legs

Oral changes:
- gingival hyperplasia, gingivitis, pyogenic granulomas and various salivary alterations 
- related to high levels of estrogen 

Dental caries 
periodontal disease 
- 30% suffer from periodontal diseases 
- elevated inflammatory markers associated with premature labor and low birth weigth 

tooth erosion -
- due to vomiting

Burning mouth syndrome 
- definition: chronic orofacial pain with intraoral burning or dysaesthetic sensation that occurs for more than 2 hrs per day on 50% of the days over more than 3 months, without evident causative lesions on clinical investigation and examination 
- triggers: anxiety and depression (it's more of a psychogenic problem)
- most common in post-menopausal women
- cause: etiology
- rule out:
- apthough stomatitis, oral ulcers, nutritional deficiencies, diabetes, etc

clinical presentation:
- burning, tingling, itching, pricking, numbness 
- mostly localized to anterior 2/3rds of the tongue; other areas affected can be: palate, lip, buccal mucosa, lateral border of tongue and floor of the mouth 

treatment: benzodiazepenes
diazepam

# Rheumatic Heart Disease
abnormal AI response to group a streptococci 

Cardiovascular diseases:
Ischemic hearts disease - lack of oxygen supply  

Causes and facts of rheumatic heart disease 
- streptococci infection - group A strep; infection throat, lungs, and heart 
- rehumatic fever - for AI response in susceptible indivudlas 
- valve damage - 
- heart failure - potential outcome 

Diagnosis:
streptococcal infection 
DNA
antistrepylase 

polyarthritis - inflammation of large joints 
carditis - inflammation of heart muscle 
subcutaneous nodules (over bones or tendons) 
erythema marginatum m- rash that begins on trunks or arms as macules then spreads out in a snake-like apperance 
recent hsitory of scarlet fever 

major criteria:
polyarthritis, carditis, subcutaneous nodules, erythema marginatum, sydenham's chorea (st. vitus dance) characteristic serious of rapid movements without purpose on face and arms 

Treatment Primary prevention
- primary - short term penicillin and erythromycin 
- secondary - longterm antibiotics 
- ibuprofen - for pain 

mitral valve most commonly affected, leading to mitral valve stenosis 

# Paget's Disease
- aka osteitis deformans - affects skul and weight-bearing bones. 
- hypertrophy 
pathophysiology of paget's disease 

Deossification - 
dysplastic rreossification - 
bone enlargement 

systemic manifestations 

Neurological problems - atypical facial nerualgia, deafness, (picture) 
most serious complication: malignancy - osteosarcoma


diagnostis 
clinical examination radiographic assessment 

cotton wool 

buccal exostosis and torus mandibularis 

CTX:
high risk <100 pg/mL
low risk >150 pg/mL low 

Epilepsy
- 2 or more unprovoked seizures more than 24 hours apart 

Seizure 
- 1 occurrence 
- no treatment necessary 

Neonatal Setiology of Seizures 
- birth asphyxia or trauma
- intracranial hemorrhage
- hypoglycemia 
- hypocalcemia or hypomagnesemia
- infections: meningitis, septicemia, tetanus neonatroum
- inborne errors of metabolism 
- pyrodoxin dependint seizures 
- maternal withdrawal of medications 

Children and adult Etiology 
- congenital conditions, like Down syndrome 
- genetic factors 
- head trauma 
- progressive brain disease 

Older adult 
- stroke
- alzheimer
- head trauma 

Generalized onset seizures 
- tonic-clonic seizures 
- preceded by an aura
- may cause vomiting and loss of bladder control 

do not prescribe aspirin and NSAIDs if the patient is taking valproic acid 
penobarbital 

cervical lymphadenopathy 

systemic diseases causing gingival enlargement - leukemia; granulomatous disease (wegener's..)
