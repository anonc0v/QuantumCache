Teeth #8 and #14
no use of electronic devices/phones/etc 
do not loosen scre; only EXAMINERS can (but in lab you can do it)
Measure your own teeth; they are all different 
Put clamp on other teeth (not on exam tooth) - because it's plastic; it might break
Maybe just use wedgets instead

Anteriors: minimum instrumentation length #35 
bring mechanical pencil to mark measurements and own probe
M&D for anteriors must be MORE than 1mm (not equal to 1mm) 
recommends: manual file + 1 MAC + 3/4 GP
passing: <2mm short less than 0.5 over; recommended: 1mm short 

The canal in anteirors goes to #50 BUT just enlarge to #35 
careful with the mesial and distal limits (esp in molars) - doesn't start at the EDGE of the tooh it starts at the marginal ridge (the peak)

posterior: access should be at least 2.5mm at widest mesi-distally and bucco-lingually
