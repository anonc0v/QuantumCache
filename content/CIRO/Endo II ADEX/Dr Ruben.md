gg 1 (#12) = 70
gg 2 (#10) = 95
gg 3 (#8) = >100

12 10, 8, 6, 4,  then go back to #6 til working length (if appropriate for your case)

after GG1, enlarge canal to #20 or #25 and find working length (confirm with radio), then go with gg2, 3

there's bacteria in the apical third that can survive starvation w/o oxygen or nutrients for 2 years, so it's very important to enlarge 

straight canals = can enlarge up to # 45/50
complex/curved canals = can enlarge to #35 

Rotary file sequencing:
1. scouting - to #10 hand file; to see if theres calcifications or curvature; or maybe there's a curve that wont let the bigger file go, so maybe you have to preflare a litttle 
	- information: size of canal, curvatures, calcifications, straight line access 
2. Preflaring
	1. hand files enlargement until a size larger than the first niti rotary files 
	2. do this when you canal ..
	3. when you cant reach working length and you already used the canal openers (12, 10, 8), then you can use a bigger file *CAREFULLY* to remove the interference/curve to help the smaller file reach working length.  situation: #10 cant go to working length, so go with #15 until it also gets stuck (not necessarily the same length as #10); then do counter-clockwise twice (while pushing very slightly), then go with #20 and do the same (even if it doesn't reach the same length as the 10 or 15 as discussed previously)
3. Glidepath 
	1. achieved when tht efile forming it can enter from the orifice and effortlessly follow the smooth canal walls uninterrupted to the terminus/working length 
	2. prepares the canal for the rotary files 

06 + preflaring + glidepath 

#10 preflaring + glide path; doesnt work/ doesn't go to working length
scenario A: use #8 then it goes to working length 
scenario B: use #8 but it doesn't go to working length.  (look at pic)

if you dont have a glidepath, the walls can push the erotary file to another area because it is non-cutting at the tip

# Perforation 

Identifying:
- 1) apex locator 
- 2) CBCT
	- canals are centered in a CBCT, but if the canal(s) are located laterally instead of centrally, then you have a perforation 
	- in an already obturated canal, as you move through the images you'll see a separation of the canal and the obturation 

Treatment:
- repair ASAP to prevent contamination of the canal through the perforation 
- Bioceramic sealers to treat perforation; but basically after preparation, you dry the canal, inject the bioceramic sealer, then push the sealer against the perforation. 
- prefers Bioceramic sealer over MTA.  
- costs 5-6x as much as MTA but you can use it in cases where you need it. theres different consistencies available.  

Prognosis:
- accessibility determines the prognosis of a perforation; normally in the cervical area you have better accessibility. 

If you have a perforation that is above the bone (suprabony), in the coronal area, the worst material is MTA because MTA is very intolerable of saliva.   you can use composite, etc.

If you have a perforation right at the crestal area (worse scenario) because there's a high chance of having a periodontal defect (recession) - so if you put MTA, there'll be salivary contamination and the seal will fail.  You can try crown lengtheing or isolate with deep marginal elevation and put GI.  

Size of perforation is important because bigger perforations have bigger chances of leaking.

If it happens in the crestal area you can use blockout resin/liquid dam; or you can use cavit with a mixture of dycal  to seal the perforation.  then you can put GI because the environment will be dry enough.  

Gingival phenotype = thin = gray staining if you use gray MTA; if you use white MTA you'll have gray stained area; Solution: Bioceramic sealers

Buccal vs lingual perforation 

materials for perforations (not necessarily all are good)
- IRM 
- bioceramic sealers: 
	- Pro Root MTA
	- EndoSequence 

Classifications:
a) Silicates (e.g. Biodentine)
	- Calcium silicates 
	- Calcium silicates with portland cement 
	- Calcium silicates without portalnd cement 
b) MTA

Bioceramics are a brand; they aren't classified 

MTA is portland cement; it's obtained from stone and extract aluminum oxide, silicate oxide, and calcium oxide, then crush and combine 
Most portland cement is contaminated with arsenic, so you can't use it from the construction 
Nowadays, MTA can be created in the lab; 

Putty MTA (picture) sets with oxygen 

Biodentine - not radiopaque. That's why its a disadvantage because if another dentist sees it, then they might think the tooth needs retreatment (because it LOOKS short since the biodentin can't be seen) even when it's okay.

MTA is a powder; just need very very very little water, like if you dip a spatula in a little water (not even a drop) then mix; then you use an amalgam carrier or special carrier to transport it 

Putty - dries easily because it reacts with oxygen. you can add sealer to fix the handling properties if it got dry. 

Characteristics:
MTA - cemento portland - perforations, pulp capping (recubrimiento); good but stains - maybe for posterior teeth 
Biodentin - not radiopaque so you want to be precise when you seal it/ want to have visibility/accesibility; if you take xray it wont show you anything 

When using bioceramic sealer, basically ignore that you have a perforation, then just inject sealer as necessary. 

Prognosis - picture 

Prognosis - 80% success rate - with correct material, technique, etc.

# Endodontic Emergencies & Therapeutics

- identify causes of emergencies 
- identify patients with a greater risk of pain after treatment 
- define flare-up... 

Emergencies 
- can be pretreatment 
- interappointment 
- postobturation 
2/3rds patient comes to the clinic for an emergency is due to pain. 

---
Emergency symptoms 
- referred pain 
- pain to swallow 
- pain that wakes them up 
- pain that lingers after stimulus 
- spontaneous pain 

emergency: unscheduled office visit "severe"
urgency "less severe" may be scheduled 

---
Does the problem disturb your....?
- sleep
- working concentration
- daily activities 

Affirmative answers to these questions require an immediate office visit

How long has this problem been bothering you?
- hours
- days 

Have you taken any pain medication?

Was the medication ineffective?
- if ineffective, it is an emergency

Golden Rule: only one tooth is the offender 
Endodontic Emergencies 
Challenges:
- pain perception 
- pain reaction 
- anxiety

--- 
Challenges 
Physical conditions
- limited mouth opening 
- systemic conditions 

Dolor
1. tomar el control 
2. ganar la confianza del paciente 
3. amabilidad 
4. el paciente es lo mas importante 
Factor psicologico es lo mas importante 

Motivo principal de consulto 

Correct Diagnosis 

Como obtener un diagnostico correcto? 
Historia medica y dental 
preguntas subjetivas 
examinacion visual 
examen intraoral 
palpacion y percusion 
pruebas pulpares 
examen radiográfico 

if pain with drinking water - cold test (cannot be due to a previously treated tooth)
if pain with hot soup - hot test; rare, but could be from a case that was previously treated (like a missed canal)
Do the test LAST on the affected tooth 
- contralateral not necessary; only in weird situations

Historia medica 
- if patient took pain killers, the endodontic tests - thermal etc, might be skewed 
- presion arterial 
- alergias 
- medicaciones 

Preguntas sujetivas 
diagnostico presuntivo
- hay algo que lo empeore o mejore?
- el dolor es difuso?
	- if diffused pain, there's something wrong with a pulp
- podria decirme de donde viene el dolor? 
- tomo alguna medicina? Funcionó?

-mainly we only do pulp tests with cold test; sometimes hot 
- 89% accurate - thermal pulp tests

Diente Fisurado 
Condición pulpar - the pulp condition will influence your decision; 
diente divido 

Fracturas radiculares 
- cbct is useful rather than PA xray
- if you see a space betewen the bone and the tooth in a cbct, could represent a crack (picture)

Sin algo que nosotros hayamos ..
Urgencias Pre-tratamiento
- manejo del paciente - calmar al paciente y solicitar al maximo su cooperacion 
- Anestesia - primer reto 
- molares inferiores 

Bloqueo n. dentario inferior 
38%; puplitis 
un solo bloqueo del nervio dentario inferior es inefectivo en el 30-80% pulpitis irreversible  (a. reader)
- existen 8 veces mas posibilidades de no obtener anestesia profunda pacientes con pulpitis irreversible que en pacientes con pulpas normales  (Hargreaves) 
if you want to do intraligamentary, use LA w/o vasocontrictor to avoid problems (palpitations) with the epinephrine, since it will go straight into the blood stream. just use 1/4th cartridge 

urgencias - 

- pulpitis irreversible y periodontitis apical 
	- for this case; remove the palatal 
- necrosis y periodontitis apical - infección 
- absceso apical - infección 

- No reason to give antibiotics 
- prescribe anti-inflammatory 

Urgencias
pulpitis irreversible C/S periodontitis Apical 
- pulpotomia pacial (unirradiculares) 
- conducto distal o palatino 
- Medicamento intraconducto - NO Alivia el dolor 
- Analgesico - nunca usar antibiotics
Fuera de oclusion? Abierto o cerrado?
Never leave a canal empty; put a medicament at least like calcium hydroxide; 
If you use calcium hydroxide in a multi-rooted tooth; wait 8-10 days because if you do it before, the calcium hydroxide has irritated the pulp of the untreated canals more and it'll be harder to anesthetize; 
- only use CaOH when patient has symptoms, big periapical lesion (b/c it means higher amount of bacteria; the sodium hypochlorite might not be enough so you want to decrease the bacterial load more)
