Traumatic dental injuries

TDI - 5% of all injuries in children in young adults
25% of all school children experience dental traumatic
33% of adults have experiences trauma to permanent, majority injuries occurring before age

Luxation injuries - most common TDIs in primary dentition
crown fracures - more for permanent teeth

important to assure a favorable outcome
-proper diagnosis
-treatment planning
-follow up

Facial trauma that results in fractured, displaced, or lost teeth can have significant negative functional, esthetic, and psychological effects on children 

the greatest incidence of trauma to the primary teeth occurs 2-3 yo when motor coordination is developing 

the most common injuries to permanet teeth occur secondary to falls, followed by traffic accidents, violence and sports 

Assessment
includes:
- medical and dental histroy
- clinical and radiographic examination
- addiontal tests such as palpation, percussion, sensitivity and mobility evaluation
- intraoral radiography is useful for evaluation of dentoalveolar trauma 
- if the area of concern extends beyond the dentoalveolar complex, extraoral imaging may be indicated 

Px Examination 
1. Neurological evaluation 
	- if the dental trauma is linked to an injury to the face or head:
		- a. did the person lose consciousness?
		- b. are they currently alert and oriented?
		- c. is there dizziness? confusion? slurring of words? nausea or voimiting? Shaking/seizing? Pupils that are different sizes?

If the patient lost consciouness, is not alert and oriented, and/or the response is YES to any of the questions, send to ER must be immediately 

2. Clean the face and the oral cavity with water or saline
3. Make a short and medical dental history
4. Questions: 
*** - Where/How/when did the injury occur?
- was there a period of unconsciousness?
- is there any disturbance in the bite?
- is there any reaction in the teeth to cold and/or heat exposure?

Patient Examination 
1. clinical exam 
2. radiographic exam 
3. photographic registration 

Clinical examination 
Examine: face, lips, oral muscles for soft tissue lesions 
Palpate: facial skeleton for signs of fractures 
Inspect: dental trauma region for: Fractures, abnormal tooth position, tooth mobility, abnormal response to percussion 
Testing: Pulp testing 

Radiographic Examination 
- the clinician should evaluate each case and determine which radiographs are required for the specific case involved 
- several conventional two-dimensional imaging projections and angulations are recommended 
- since maxillary central incisors are the most frequently affected teeth, the radiographs listed below are recommended to thoroughly examine the injured area. 
        1. parallel periapical radiograph aimed through the **midline** to show the 2 maxillary central incisors 
		2. one parallel periapical radiograph aimed at the **maxillary right lateral incisors** (should show right canine and central incisor) 
		3. one parallel periapical radiograph aimed at the **maxillary left lateral incisor** (should also show the left canine and central incisor) 
		4. one **maxillary occlusal** radiograph 
		5. at least one parallel periapical radiograph of the lower incisors centered on the 2 mandibular centrals 
		6. other radiographs may be indicated if there are obvious injuries of the mandibular teeth (similar to the maxillary teeth) 
		The **occlusal radiograph** is particularly helpful in the **detection of lateral luxations, root fractures, and alveolar bone fractures.** 
	
Clinical history 
- treatment planning takes into consideration the patient's health status and developmental status, as well as extent of injuries 
- all relevant diagnostic information, treatment, and recommended follow-up care are documented in the patient's record 

Types of dental trauma 
Enamel infraction - incomplete fracture (crack) of the enamel without loss of tooth structure 
Dx: normal gross anatomic and radiographic appearance; craze lines apparent, especially with transillumination 
tx objectives: to maintain structural integrity and pulp vitality 
gen prognosis: complications are unusual 

Crown fracture uncomplicated 
- enamel fracture 
- enamel-dentin fracture 

def: an enamel fracture or an enamel-dentin fracture that does not involve the pulp 
dx: clinical and/or radiographic findings reveal a loss of tooth structure confined to the enamel or to both the enamel and dentin 
tx objectives: to maintain pulp vitality and restore normal esthetics and function. for small fractures, rough margins and edges can be smoothed. for larger fractures, the lost tooth structure can be restored 
general prognosis: depends primarily upon the concomitant injury to the periodontal ligament and secondarily upon the extent of dentin exposed 

crown fracture complicated 
enamel-dentin pulp-fracture 

def: an enamel-dentin fracture w/ pulp exposure 
dx: clinical and radiographic findings reveal a loss of tooth structure with pulp exposure 
tx objectives: to maintain pulp vitality and restore normal esthetics and function 

--- 
complicated crown fractures:
general prognosis: depend primarily upon a concomitant injury to th eperiodontal igament 
the age of pulp exposure, extent of dentin exposed, and stage of root development at the time of injury secondarily affect the tooth's prognosis 

primary teeth: decisions often are based on life expectancy of the traumatized teeth and vitality of the pulpal tissue  
alternatives of treatment: pulpotomy, pulpectomy and extraction 
permanent teeth: evidence suggest that utilizing conservative pulp therapies for mature teeth with closed apices is as appropriate a management technique as when used for inmature teeth with open apices 
alternatives of treatment: 
direct pulp capping, partial pulpotomy, full pulpotomy and pulpectomy (start of root canal therapy) 

--- 
 Crown/root fracture 
 definition: an enamel, dentin, and cementum fracture with or without pulp exposure
 complicated means pulp is exposed 
 
clinical findings:
- mobile coronal fragment attached to the gingiva w/ or without a pulp exposure 
- radiographic findings 
	- radiolucent oblique line that comprises crown and root 
	- -primary teeth: vertical direction 
	- permanent teeth: perpendicular direction to the central radiographic beam 
	- root fractures can only be diagnosed radiographically 

Tx objectives 
- to maintain pulp vitality and restore normal esthetics and function 
- general prognosis: most fractured permanent teeth can be saved. fractures extending significantly below the gingival margin may not be restorable 

primary teeth: when the primary tooth cannot or should not be restored, extract, unless retrieval of the apical fragments may result in damage to the succedaneous tooth 

Permanent teeth: the emergency treatment objective is to stabilize the coronal fragment 
definite treatment alternatives: 
remove the coronal fragment followed by a supragingival restoration gingivectomy 
- osteotomy 
- surgical or orthodontic extrusion to prepare for restoration 
- if the pulp is exposed, pulpal treatment alternatives are pulp capping, pulpotomy, and root canal treatment 

Root fracture 
def: a dentin and cementum fracture involving the pulp 
dx: clinical finding reveal a mobile coronal fragment attached to the gingiva that may be displaced. 
radiographic findings may reveal 1 or more radiolucent lines that separate the tooth fragments in horizontal fractures 
general prognosis: pulp necrosis in root-fractured teeth is attributed to displacement of the coronal fragment and mature rooth development 

primary teeth: 
treatment alternatives : a) extraction of coronal fragment without insisting on removing apical fragment or observation  *** not recommended to reposition and stabilize the coronal fragment 
permanent teeth: a) reposition and stabilize the coronal fragment in its anatomically correct position as soon as possible to optimize healing of the periodontal ligament and neurovascular supply while maintainin gesthetic and functional integrity 

Concussion
Definition: injury to the tooth-supporting structures w/o abnormal loosening or displacement of the tooth.
Dx: clinical findings: picture 

concussion: mobility -, displacement -, percussion pain + 

Subluxation
Definition: injury to tooth-supporting structures w/ abnormal loosening but without tooth displacement 
Dx: Because the periodontal ligament attempts to absorb the injury, clinical findings reveal a mobile tooth w/o displaement that may or may not have sulcular bleeding
radiographic abnormalities are not expected 
Tx objectives: to optimize healing of the periodontal ligament and neurovascular supply 
mobility +, - displacement, +bleeding from the sulcus 

Subluxation: primary teeth -  follow for pathology 
permanent teeth: stabilize the tooth and relievee any occlusal interferences
for comfort, a flexible splint can be used for no more than 2 weeks 
prognosis: the primary tooth should return to normal within 2 weeks 
- mature permanent teeth w/ closed apices may under pulpal necroses; folow up closely 
--- 

Lateral Luxation 
Definition: displacement of the tooth in a direction other than axially. The periodontal ligament is torn and contusion or fracture of the supporting alveolar bone occurs. 
clinical findings: the tooth is displaced laterally with the crown usually in a paltal or lingual direction. The tooth is usually not mobile or tender to touch. 
Radiographic findings reveal an increase in periodontal ligament space and displacement of apex toward or through the labial bone plate 

picture 
primary 
permanent teeth 

prognosis:
primary: requiring repositioning have an increased risk of developing pulp necrosis compared to theth that are left to spontaneously reposition 
permanent teeth: teeth with closed apices,pulp necrosis and pulp canal obliteration are common healing complications while progressive root resorption is less likely to occur 

--- 

Intrusion 
Definition: apical displacemen tof tooth into the alveolar bone. the tooth is driven into the socket, compressing the periodontal ligament and commonly causes a crushing fracture of the alveolar socket 
Clinical findings: REveal the tooth appears to be shortened or, in severe cases, it may appear missing. the tooth is not mobile or tender to touch.
Radiographic findings 
- tooth appears displaced apically and the PDL is not continuous 

-- - 
Intrusion 
Determination of the relationship of an intruded primary tooth with the follicle of the succedaneous tooth is mandatory 
if the apex is displaced labially, the apical tip can be seen radiographically with the tooth appearing shorter than its contra-lateral 
if the apex is displacemt palatally towards the permanent tooth germ, the apical tip cannot be seen radiographically and the tooth appears elongated 
- an intruded young permanet tooth may mimic and erupting tooth 
Intrusion 
-primary teeth 
tx: picture 

immature: teeth with more eruptive potential, the objective is to allow for spontaneous eruption
mature: reposition the tooth w/ orthodontic or surgical extrusion and initiate endotonic tx w/in the first 3 weeks of the traumatic incidence 
prognosis: picture 

Extrusion:

Avlusion

 Splinting 
 - to restore a fractured tooth's normal esthetics and function, reattachmen tof th ecrown fragment is an alternative that should be considered
 - to stabilize a tooth following traumatic injury, a splint may be necessary. 
 - Flexible splinting assists in healing 

Ideal characteristics of the ideal splint 
1. easily fabricated in the mouth without additional trauma 
2. passive unless orthodontic forces are intended 
3. allows physiologic mobility 
4. nonirritating to soft tissues 
5. does not interfere with occlusion 
6. allows endodontic access and vitality testing 
7. easily cleansed 
8. easy removed 

Types of splints 
splints are classified according to the magnitude of mobility that allow the tooth once splinted 
a distinction is made between 
flexible splints 
rigid splints 
semi-rigid splints 

You have to ensure that the points of sutures in

Extraoral examination 

Abrasion - remove 

circumorbital ecchymosis may be signs suggestive of facial fracutres, and infraorbital margins should be assessed for a step deformity. 
- classic sign for facial fractures are circumorbital ecchymosis 

most lacerations and abrasions of the buccal mucosa heal quickly and do not require sutuing
large lacerations >1-2cm should be repaires using 4-0 sutures. if deep, a two layer closure can be performed.  

Injuries to the gingiva 
- bleeding around gingival margins may indicate damage to the periodontal ligament, for example, with a subluxation injury. 
- small lacerations over the maxillary of mandibular gingiva usually heal uneventfully without intervention.
- if the laceration is large and gaping or there is bone exposed or a flap present, the edges should be approximated with 4-0 resorbably sutures.  
- if there is a shortage of tissue, the adjacent teeth can be used as anchors by wrapping the suture around them. 
---
# Injuries to the frenulum 

- the maxillary frenulum rarely requires sutures for simple lacerations, but more complex lacerations extending into the surrounding mucosa or gingiva should be approximated with absorbable suture material.  
- painful

--- 
Injuries to the tongue 
- most <1cm without gaping wound edges may not require repair. 
- lacerations that gape need suturing, as the cleft left by the non-repaired wound can re-epithelialize, leaving a grooved or bifid appearance (temporarily); normally will regress spontaneously with time.

complications-sequelae after dental trauma 

In primary teeth:
external root resorption, internal root resorption, ankylosis, affects permanent teeth 

How does dental trauma in primary teeth affect permanet teeth?
- enamel hypomineralization  - spot of different color on crown
- enamel hypoplasia - lack of tisssue
- alteration inthe eruption sequence
- alteration in the eruption axis 
--- 

Complications after dental trauma: Permanent teeth
- Loss of pulp vitality 
- spontaneous pain with abnomral response to vitality tests 
- root resorption 

Followups are mandatory after traumatic injuries:
each ofllow up should include questioning of the patient about any signs or symptoms, plus clinical and radiographic examinations and pulp sensibility testing. 

- the main post-traumatic complications are as folows: ulpl necrosis and infection pulp space obliteration several types of root resorption, breakdown of marginal gingiva and bone. 
- early detection and management of complications improves prognosis 
- every efffort should be made to preserve the pulp, in both mature and immature teeth. 
- in ammature permanet teeth, this is of utmost importance in order to allow continued root development and apex formation. 
- the pulp of an immature permanent tooth has considerable capacity for healing after a traumatic pulp eexposure, luxation injury or root fracture 
- pulp exposures secondary to TDIs are amenable to conservative pulp therapies, such as pulp capping, partial pulportomy, shallow or partial pulpotomy and cervical ulpotomy, which aim to mainitain the pulp and allow for continued root development 
-

Prognosis for traumatized teeth 
- factors:
	- age of patient and degree of root formation and apical closure 
	- amount of exposed dentine and pulp 
	- time interval between injury and treatment 
	- degree of contamination 
	- periodontal injury 
	- level of patient cooperation 

Prognosis for traumatized teeth 
- pulpal necrosis and periapical infection are related to the time between injury and fixation 
- teeth repositioned within 1 hour are less likely to undergo pulpal necrosis 
- if more than 48 hours elapse b/w injury and treatment, then the incidence of future pulpal necrosis is greater 

Prognosis for traumatized teeth 
- if the apex of the tooth is in the line of the fracture, the risk of pulpal necrosis is also increased 
- internal fixation of dentoalveolar fractures also increases the risk of necrosis of the teeth in the fracture segment and adjacent teeth 
- root canal obliteration is a more common sequel in people aged under 20 years, and marginal bone loss is seen if the bone segments are not properly aligned 

Tetanus prophylaxis 
- intoxication manifested primarily by a neuromuscular dysfunction caused by a potent exotoxin called tetanospamina produced by clostridium tetanis
- the spores of C tetanis are extremely resistant and do not there is essentially natural immunity against tetanus toxin. 
- thats why universally and for all age groups,  primary immunization with tetanus toxoid and subsequent vaccination or efforts to maintain the level of antitoxins 

Tetanus toxoid is an effective antigen and once primary immunization ins completed, it usually induces levels of antibodies that protect for up to 10 years. 
- tetanus toxoid is available as a monovalent (tt) or combined (cpt, dt u dta) vaccine, absorbed in aluminum hydroxide or phosphate. 
- in practice, vaccination has shown more than 99% efficacy in preventing traumatic tetanus, and some 100% efficacy in the prevention of neonatal tetanus.

Immunizing agent 
basic schedule: 3 doses of 0.5 mL will be applied 
the first 2 doses no less than 4 weeks apart and the third 1 year after the 2nd dose was applied 
when the vaccination schedule is interrupted, they must complete the missing doses at intervals equal to those indicated for the regular schedule, without taking into the account the time since the last dose. 

Tetanus prophylaxis 
- while vaccination during the childhood should confer sufficient protection agains tetanus, may be necessary reinforce it throughout life if at all there are entrance doors (exposed injury)
- prophylaxis of tetanus needed after a continuity solution depends on the degree of contaminatino of this and the patient's vaccination history 

Indications for application of human tetanus immunoglobulin 
- wound contaminated with excrement, soil or saliva 
- puncture wounds 
- superficial tissue avulsions 
- missile wounds 
- burns 
- and in those who have never receieved previous immunization or it is unkown. 

Indications for application of human tetanus immunoglobulin 
- although most people receiev tetanus immunization and boosters, it cannot be assumed that this is always the case. 
- consider tetanus prophylaxis if the patient hasn't receieved a booster within the last 5 years. 
- a tetanus booster may be required if environmental contamination of the injury has occured. if in doubt, refer to a medical practitioner within 48 hours. 

Root fracture (cervical third) only one indicated for rigid splinting

Periodontium in Children 
 
Periodontium includes the tissues that surround and support the teeth 
tissues: gingiva, cementum, PDL, alveolar bone 

Features of periodontium in a primary dentition 
- the gingiva in primary dentition appears to be more reddish, vascular, and flabby and to lack stippling 
- periodontal ligaments in children are wider and have less dense fibers 
- alveolar bone in primary dentition has less trabecula and calcification, more marrow spaces, and greater blood supply and lymphatic drainage
- at the molecular level, some investigators reported that periodontium of the primary dentition resorbed more easily because it contains more sialoprotein and osteoprotein, which facilitate the binding of odontoclast 

Differences between adults and children periodontium 
Children / adults
Gingival colour - more reddish/coral pink
contour - free gingival margin-rounded/gingival margin knife edge
consistency - flabby due to less CT density and lack of organized collagen fiber bundles/ firm and resilient
surface texture - stippling absent in infancy. mostly seen by age 6 years / stipping present 
interdental area - saddle shaped gingiva/ papillary gingiva 
gingival sulcus - 2.1-2.3 mm / 2-3mm 
attached gingiva. - width increases with age and concomitant decrease in sulcus depth / greater in adults 

Features of. a healthy periotonium 
- in children with a healthy gingival and periodontal status the gingival margin is several millimeters coronal to the CEJ 
- the gingival sulcus may be 0.5mm - 3mm deep on a fully erupted tooth 
- in teenagers with a healthy periodontium the alveolar crest is situated between 0.4mm - 1.9mm apical to the CEJ

# Gingival and periodontal diseases

Definition 
- periodontal diseases constitue a group of conditions that are considered nowadays ubiquitous among childeren, adolescents, and adults 
- the term "periodontal diseases" includes any inherited or acquired disorders of the tissues that are investing adn supporting the teeth (gingiva, cmeentumm, pdl and alvoelar bone)

Epidemiology (for gingivitis)
- 82.1% - prevalence of gingivitis amongst adolescents in the US; Albandar 
- similar findings of high prevalence reported worldwide 

Epidemiology (for periodontitis)
- 0.6% of the subjects were having juvenile periodontitis at the age of 13-15 
- 2.75% of the subjects were having chronic periodontitis at the age of 16-17 
- **low prevalence of periodontitis among children and adolescents** 

**Current and early studies show that gingivitis occurs in half the population by age 4-5 years and peaks to nearly 100% at puberty** 
- morphological changes in the primary, mixed, and permanent dentition reflect typical patterns of oral growth and deelopment 
- the ability to distinguish normal physiological changes from gingival  and periodontal disease 

- **Maintenance and restoration of gingival and periodontal health during childhood and adolsescence will facilitate healthy gingival and periodontal health at older ages**
- early diagnosis ensures the greatest opportunity for successful treatment, primarily by reducing risk factors 

Causes 
- pathogenic microorganism in the oral biofilm or dental plaque that accumulates around teeth 
- picture - causes 
- aggregatibacter (actinobacillus), p. gingivales, t forsythensis, t. denticola, candida albicans, herpes viruses in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases among immune-compromised childresn; genetic, developmental, traumatic, neoplastic, and metabolic factors; some systemic diseases and medications also have periodntal manifestatiosn 

CLASSIFICAITON
Gingivitis 
- reversible and nondestructive form of periodontal diseases 
- it is the inflammation of the marginal gingiva that may progress to include free and attached gingiva but does not cause attachment loss. 

Periodontitis 
- it is the inflammation the tooth supporting tissue, which is accompanied by loss of connective tissue attachment and breakdown of the supporting alveolar bone 
- may progress to cause exposure of the roots, mobility, and premature loss of the teeth 

World Workshop Classification (2017)
- 3 main categories 
	- 1. periodontitis (single category grouping the two forms of the disease aggressive or chronic)
	- 2. necrotizing periodontitis 
	- 3. periodontitis as a manifestation of systemic conditions 
- takes into consideration the presence of plaque biofilm and that the inflammatory response to plaque biofilm is an age-dependent phenomenon 

Diagnosis may include genetic, microbiological and biochemical tests or gingival biopsy 
- diagnosis involves staging and grading of periodontal disease 
- staging considers the severity and extent of disease while grading assess the future risk of periodontitis progression and anticipated treatment outcomes 

1. Clinical health 
1. clinical gingival health on an intact periodontium 
2. clinical gingival health on a reduced periodontium 
	a. stable periodontitis patient 
	b. unstable periodontitis patient 

2. Gingivitis-dental biofilm-induced 
a. associated with dental biofilm alone
b. mediated by systemic or local risk factors 
drug-influenced gingival enlargement 

--- 
# Halitosis (breath odor or bad breath)
- anaerobic bacterial breakdown of organic substrate. 
- coated tongue majority of cases of bad breath
- halitosis caused by physiologic or pathologic processes. 

Halitosis - sulfur-producing bacteria 

Physiologic factors 
- food intake
- smoking
- decreased salivary function gastroesophageal disorders mouth breathing
- nasal obstructions including sinusitis, foreign bodies or tonsil stones

Persistent halitosis typically reflects a pathologic process such as:
- periodontal disease pericoronitis 
- recurrent major apthous ulcers infected w/ gram (-) anaerboic bacteria 
- herpetic gingovostamtitis 
- necrotizing gingivitis-periodontitis 

Treatment of Halitosis 
- reduction of substrates for bacteria, chemical reduction of bacterial load, and masking odor. 
- tongue scraping or cleaning prior to tooth brushing 
- antimicrobials such as chlorhexidine w/w/o scaling and root planning use of mints or chewing gum to mask odors 

# Respiratory diseases affecting the periodontium 

- health of the periodonitum depends on saliva's mechanical cleansing and antimicrobial properties 
- respiratory diseases, either directly (mouth breathing) or through side effects (Xerostomia) of therapeutic agents, may alter salivry flow. 
- nasopharyngeal obstruction from adenoid and tonsillar hypertrophy 

Recommendations
- evaluate the patient's health history and medications in order to identify respiratory conditions and medications that impact salivary flow and dental and periodontal health 
- if airway obstruction is determined to affect periodontal health, an evaluation by an otolaryngologist is recommended 
- consider a multidisciplinary approach, refferal and or care coordination for patients with general and or oral health problems associated with respiratory diseases 

# oral conditions related to immunosuppressive or radiation therapies 

1. gingival bleeding 
2. soft tissue necrosis 
3. salivary gland dysfunction 
4. opportunistic infections (.e., candidiasis, herpes simplex virus) 
5. oral graft-versus-host disease are among the many acute and long-term complications associated with these therapies.  

# drug-influenced gingival enlargements 

1. anticonvulsants (e.g. phenytoin, sodium valproate) 
2. calcium channel blockers (e.g., verapamil, diltiazem) 
3. immunosuppressants (e.g., cyclosporine). 
4. Most cases, the gingival enlargement is induced by the combination of the drugs (i.e. fibrotic aspect) and the plaque biofilm (i.e. inflammatory aspect)

treatment options:
1. possible drug discontinuation or change 
2. biofilm control by means of home oral hygiene, use of antimicrobial agents, frequent professional cleaning, and removal of plaque-retentive areas (faulty restorations)
3. surgical removal of enlarged gingiva (gingivectomy using a scalpel or laser-assissted therapy, flap surgery, or electrosurgery) and may include possible drug discontinuation or change. 

# infections of bacterial fungal, and viral origins 

- the gingiva may demonstrate a variety of lesions that are not caused by plaque biofilm and usually do not resolve after plaque biofilm removal 
- 1. infections of bacterial origin (necrotizing gingivitis)
- 2. fungal origin (candidiasis)
- 3. viral origin (primary herpetic gingivostomatitis, reccurent intraoral herpes simplex infection) 

Recommendations 
- elimination or reduction of all local and systemic risk factors that contribute to the infection initiatiton or progression is needed for treatment completeness, followed by close monitoring to assess treatment effectiveness, patient compliance and risk of recurrencej

# gingival problems that are commonly seen in c hildren and adolescents 

1. Eruption gingivitis 
- gingival inflammation normally accompanies eruption process 
- poor oral hyginee by neglect or as a consequence of malalignment of the erupting teeth will aggravate gingival inflammation 
- usually, the condition will subisde as the oral hygiene improves and thte tooth reaches normal occlusion 
- plaque control regimen is the treatment of eruption gingivitis. 

2. pubertal gingivitis 
- also called steroid hormone-related gingivitis is defined as exacerbation of gingivitis by fluctation in gonadotrophic hormone levels during puberty 
- similar condition is seen during pregnancy and in females taking contraceptives. 
- the condition can be explained as any increase in the levels of estrogen and progesterone in the gingival tissues resulting in vasodilatation and proliferation, increase in gingival vascularity, and increase in susceptibility of inflammation in the presence of local factors.  

Characterized by:
- swelling of the interdental papilla with spontaneous gingival hemorrhage 
- professional prophylaxis and removal of the local factors combined with good orgal hygiene regimen at home will result in major improvements 
- in some cases, gingival swelling becomes fibrotic and necessitates surgical excision in the future. 

3. Gingivitis related to mouth breathing, 
- mouth-breathing causes desiccation of the oral tissue and consequently gingival inflammation and halitosis 
- immediate management for the problem includes:
	- maintaining good oral hygiene 
	- lubrication of the tissue 
	- the use of the oral screen to cover the tissue during sleeping 
- elimination of the problem requires comprehensive treatment plan by an orthodontist and an otolaryngologist. 

4. drug-induced gingival overgrowth 
- certain classes of medications have been approved to cause dgingival overgrowth and aggravate gingival inflammation in the presence of local factors
a. cyclosporine (immune-depressant)
b. phenytoin (anticonvulsant) 
c. calcium channel blockers (antiphyerptensive) such as nifedipine, verapamil, and amlodipine. 

- usually starts at the interdental area and then spreads to include marginal gingiva 
- occasionally, it can be so severe to cover the incisal and occlusal surfaces of the teeth 
- however, its severity is closely related to the amount of accumulated plaque 
- the pathogenesis of this condition is uncertain yet 

Management 
- starts from improving patient's oral hygiene by both mechanical and chemical plaque control techniques 
- professional scaling and polishing to remove all the local aggravating factors 
- sometimes, gingivectomy and gingivoplasty are needed for gingival recontouring in order to oimprove esthetic and hygiene 
- dentist should not try to stop or replace patient medictions 

5. Gingivitis associated with malnutrition 
- there is strong evidence that hypovitaminoses and mineral deficiency associated with specific manifestation in oral and perioral area may lead to periodontal diseases 
- vitamin C deficiency will cause scurvy, is manifested as a decrease in the production and maintenance of collagen 
- "scorbutic gingivitis" resulsts when severe vitamin C deficiency is combined with poor oral hygiene. 
- is characterized by painful gingival swelling, gingival edema, and hemorrhage on slight provocation, fetid odor, rapid development of periodontal pocket, and tooth loss. 

6. primary herpetic gingivostomatitis 
- is defined as an acute gingival condition that is caused by **Herpes simplex virus type I.** 
- its clinical picture is characterized by a painful gingival inflammation and vesicles that are formed mainly on the dorsum of the tongue, hard palate, and gingiva. 
- those vesicles ruptured eventually, leaving a painful ulcer with a yellow gray floor and red halo. 
- characterized by 
	- lymphadenopathy, fever, and malaise are common systemic features for herpetic gingivostamatitis 
	- it is commonly affecting children under the age of 10 with peak incidence at 2-4 years of age. 
	- the condition is self-limiting and required symptomatic treatment only 
	- however, systemic antiviral therapy is needed in immunocompromised patients.  

7. Pericoronitis 
- pericoronitis refers to an inflammatory lesion developed when food debris and mbacteria are present beneath the excess flap of soft tissue surrounding partially-erupted teeth. 
- the pericoronal flap of soft tissue may be chronic without any symptoms; however, when acute, patients may experience severe pain, mouth opening restriction, gingival abcess, cellulitis, fever, lymphadenopahty, and presence or risk of systemic complications.

Diagnosis and recording 
 A thorough history, examination an dperiodontal screening are integral to diagnosis, treatment planning and recording of findings. 
 - as in adults, the routine dental examination of children and eadolescents should comprise an extra-oral examination and an intra-oral assessment which should include examination of the soft and hard tissues in addition to a general description of the periodtonal condition. 

clincial periodontal examination 
- a not should be made of abnormal gingival colour, contour, swelling, the presene and location of inflammation, recession or suppuration. 
-  a qualitative asssessment of oral hygiene status shoudl be made and the presence of suprgingival calculus deposits recroded 
- local periodontal risk factors, plaque retention factors, location of high frenal attachments, malocclusion, the presence of mouthbreathing and incompetent lip seal, should be identified. 

periodontal risk assessment (PRA)
- Risk factors for periodontal disease are complex and may be biological, environmental (social), and behavioral. 
- PRA identifies risk factors that place individuals at an increased risk of develpoing gingival and periodontal diseases and pathologies, as well as factors that influence the progression of the disease 
- PRA can improve clinical decision making an dallows the implementation of indiivdualized treatment planning na dproactive targeted interventions.  

General considerations 
- a periodontal assessment includes a discussion of the chief complaint, detailed medical, dental, and social history reviews, extra and intra-oral examinations, radiographs, and periodontal probing as indicated. 
- bleeding on probing (BOP) in primary teeth during early childhood, even at a low number of sites, is indicative of high susceptibility to periodontal diseases, due to the age-dependent reactivity of the gingival tissues to plaque biofilm. 

- probing assesmsnet may be intiatied after eruption of the first permannt molars and incisors and only it toelerated by the child. 
- psuedopockets (greater than three millimeters (mm) may be present around partially and newly erupted teeth. 
- probing assessment on primary teeth is required before the eruption of the first permanent molars and incisors when clinical and radiographic findings indicate the presence of periodontal diseases. 
- assessing for generalized (i.e. involving 30 or more percent of the teeth) gingivitis may be performed for patients unable to undergo probing due to age, anxiety, or SHCN (special health care needs). 
- alveolar bone loss in the primary dentition indicated increased susceptibility to periodontal disease. 
- for patient in the primary dentition, a visual assessment of the gingiva should be part of every comprehensive oral evluation and periodoc examination 
- all dental radiographs should be examined fo revidence of caries, alvoelar bone loss, developmental anomalies, and other pathologies 

Practitioners may use the estimated risk level to establish a periodicity an dintensity of diagnostic, counseling, and therapetuic interventions 
- the treatment plan should be used to establish the methods and rsequence of delivering periodontal treatment and include :
- - periodontal procedures to be performed
