Enamel:
- 96% inroganic matter
- 3% agua
- 1% organic

Dentin
 - 70% inorganic matter 
 - 20% organic (mostly type I collagen fibers, proteoglycans and glycoprotein)
 - 10-15% of water 

Why important to know histology?
Adhesive failures = degradation of collagen matrix by **Proteolytic enzymes***: MMP (metalloproteinases)

1. why is it important to know how much water the enamel or dentin has? 

Dentinal tubule morphology 
- WIDER near the pulp : diameter at pulp = 2-3 m; diameter at DEJ = 0.5 - 1 
- MORE dentinal tubules per unit area near the pulp 
- at pulp: 45k per mm2  (DOUBLE)
- DEJ: 20k per mm2   

Near DEJ 
- you might have some challenges to adhere with dentinoenamel junction 
- how well do adhesive agents interact with collagen?
- how well it penetrates and holds in those tubes

Problem 2
- near the pulp, there's more water, and more sensitivity
- Dr. Carlos likes the smear layer (in deeper cavities)

Chlorhexidine - MMP Inhibitors 
- Antimicrobial  
- non-specific MMP inhibitor - increases the preservation of dentin adhesion strength 
- Prevents proteolytic degradation through the immobilization of MMPs, **Increases adhesion longevity** 

What are the MMPs?
They are enzymes that break down extracellular collagen/protein matrix  

Conclusion number 1 
- after etching, use chlorhexidine
		- why? Because after etching, the MMPs will be activated 

Adhesive 
- contains
	- Monomer (hydrophobic and hydrophilic), mainly methacrylates 
	- Solvents: Water, ethanol and ketone 
	- Photoinitiators: Canphorquinone, phenylpropandione, Luzerin, Ivocerin 

Monomer 
-BisGMA - is the most common monomer; works as an excellent bonding agent when applied to Enamel (hydrophobic), very hydrophobic monomers such as big-GMA cannnot infiltrate it well after demineralization. 
- for this reason, more hydrophilic monomers are often used to improve wetting properties 
- for example, (HEMA - hydrophilic) is completely miscible in water. 

WAter:
Ketone 
Alcohol 
They increase wettability 

Solvents:
Hydrophilic monomers, the Primer components of adhesive systems contain organic solvents to increase the wettability and infiltration of the adhesive resins into the dentin substrate 
- they work as diluting agents for the resin mixture. 
- Ethanol and water are very hydrophilic and promote the interaction between monomers and dentinal water. 
- Acetone works by removing water from dentin 

hydrophilic - Primer - solvents are here not in the bonding ; air it out to evaporate the water/ketone/water (carrier molecules)
hydrophobic - Bonding agent 

Photoinitiators 
- during polymerization reaciton, the hydrophoilic and hyrophobic monomers must be properly cross-linked to obtain a strong adhesive layer. 
- however, the simultaneous presence of hydrophilic and hydrophobic monomers has frequently been associated with nanophase separation phenomena, especially in **simplified adhesives** (one bottle)
- which leads to development of inhomogenous adhesive layers. 

classification of adhesive bonding systems 
picture 

Monomers:
Bis-GMA (hydophilic)
TEGMA
HEMA (hydrophobic)

Bifunctional monomers:
10-MDP - used for zirconia; has a hydrophilic end (with the ethanol) and hydrophobic end (with the phosphate); very long chain so the hydrophilic and hydrophobic end are further away from each other than DPDM
GPDM - shorter chain than 10-MDP; so the hydrophilic and hydrophobic ends are closer to each other, which isn't good 



13-year study on 4th generation OptiBond FL (Kerr) gold-standard Etch and Rinse adhesive - **total etch** 
6th generation - selective enamel E&R and SE Adhesives - **Selective-etch** ; on exam this is 2 step

martin brannstrom - hydrodynamic theory - change in pressure within dentinal tubules causes sensitivity/pain
hydrodynamic theory - anita aminoshariae 2021 

asbi EG. et col 1987; the hydrodynamic theory of dentin hypersensitivity 
- changes in the flow of the fluid in the dentinal tubules can trigger pain receptors present on nerve endings in the pulpal aspect to fire nerve impulses; 

Dental sensitivity: (in reference to DEEP CAVITIES)
- hydrodynamic flow can be increased by changes: temperature, humidity, air pressure, osmotic pressure,    cold foods and drinks 
- CONTROL THE AIR do not overdry, because you'll cause extrusion of the odontoblastic processes; you want WET DENTIN (a concept) so that the primer will mix with the wet dentin instead of dry dentin and the odontoblastic process 
- so how to avoid?  so in patients, you want to PRESERVE the smear layer, especially in deeper layers to avoid dental sensitivity 

Clearfil - Self-etch; diagram is for Deep dentin 

Is there a difference between vital teeth vs endodontically treated with direct composite restoration?  edina lampel 
Immediate dental sealing (IDS)
- the immediate application of a dentin-bonding agent after tooth presep and before impression taking:
	- advantages:
		- bacterial microleakage
		- hypersensitivity 
		- bonding quality 
- steps: etching, chlorhexiding, primer, bonding, cure 

quiz next class 
which system 
direct composite or onlay/inlay  

1. how deep is preparation? (adhesive system) (4th gen - total etch or 6th gen - selective-etch)
2. how much remaining tooth structure do we have?  Preparation design
3. am I going to do a direct or indirect restoration? (resin coating or ids) 
4. which material should i use? (composite, lithium disilicate, zirconia)

2.5-3mm cusp thickness - comparable to vital 

Resin Coating - should only be 0.3mm to 1mm thick 
can eliminate undercuts (otherwise you have to prep more to remove undercuts)
- after applying the resin coating, you can do the final preparation; should NOT be on enamel 

In clinics:
orange: system onlay 
yellow Systemp onlay 

>2.5mm cuspal thickness = can leave
 < 2.5mm extend and remove cusp 

2.5mm for nonworking cusps = leave 
3.0mm for working cusps = leave 
<2.5mm for NWC or <3.0mm remove cusp 

with Onlays, it easier to polish, preserves tooth structures, margins are easily accessible and visible, 

Immediate dental sealing (IDS)

Indications for Resin coating vs IDS 
Resin coating: (uses flowable composite after application)
- indirect restoration 
- cavities more than 2mm 
- layer from 0.3 to 1mm 
- indirect restorations 
- more for posteriors 
- enamel MUST NOT BE INCLUDED 
IDS: (- do not use flowable composite in this case)
- indirect restorations 
- conservative preparations 
- limited space 
- veneers 
- crown prep. minimally invasive 
- enamel MUST NOT BE INCLUDED 

Adhesion in Patients with primary dentition?

Molar Hypomineralization (HM) 
- color
	- between white, yellow and brown to large areas of surface breakup 
	- Brown: greater susceptibility to fractures 
	- if it is fractures it could be difficult to distinguish between enamel hypoplasia (edges of helath enamel lesion are rounded) 
	- Dentin defect of systemic origin: 6 years molar;incisors (HIM); reduction 5-40% mineral

Mexico: 35.4% prevalence of HM

--- 
Treatment of HM
1. prevention (early diagnosis)
2. identification of caries factors; remineralization; oral hygiene 
3. desensitization 

- the success of this approach is unkown 
- prevent caries depends on severity 
- MI Paste
---
2. Restorative treatments 
	1. resin or ceramic inlays
	2. precise clinical delimitation of normal enamel 
	3. ionomer patient with sensibility wait 6 months max. (then change for direct or indirect restoration) 
	4. extensive and repetetive restorative treatment - due to weak adhesion (since there is less mineral)

# Restoration of Endodontically treated teeth 

#journal/prostho  - Biomechanical failures of restored nonvital teeth today still are critical issue in prosthetic dentistry 

post - similar resilience??? to dentin 

- Biomechanical changes following by endodontic therapy 
	- tissue composition 
		- loss of moisture 9%, but the rest of the composition is the same
		- Dental adhesion given loss of water?
	- dentine micro and macrostructure 
		- there is no evidence in the literature showing weakness in vital or non-vital dentin 
	- tooth structure 
		- major changes in tooth biomechanics: 
			- loss of tissue (caries lesion)
			- fractures cavity preparation (access cavity)

---
Ninja access - fracture resistance of tooth decreases by 5%; 
Loss of marginal ridges reduces fracture resistance by 65%

Do you think the cavity access design is important?
#journal/orstho 
Fracture resistance of 

Modulus of elasticity 
-dentin 18GPa 
-Fiber Post 23-28 GPa 
-Gold 80 GPa 
-Titanium 110GPa
-Stainless steel 200Gpa
-Zirgonium 200 GPa
-Aluminum oxide 300Gpa

Metal Post - stress is concentrated on apical 3rd of tooth 

Fiber posts:
- exhibit relatively uniform stress distribution to the root 
- fiber posts have elastic moduli similar to dentin 
- fiber posts are easy to place, cost effective, and esthetic 
- glass fiber posts are associated with low catastrophic failure rates compared to other post types - forces are distributed rather than concentrated in one area; post doesn't have to go as deep since adhesion works well with fiber posts

Evidence-based treatment planning for the restoration of endodontically treated single teeth : importance of coronal seal, post vs no post, and indirect vs direction restoration 
- Alain Atlas, Marco Martignoli 2019 
1. importance of coronal seal 
2. post vs no posts 
3. indirect vs direct restoration 

Success rate dropped by 44% with poor coronal seal (need smooth margins, good prep)

Systemp inlay and systemonlay 

ferulle effect 2-3mm 

Do we need to etch inside?

LuxaBond-Total Etch 
- need to etch all the way inside and USE A SYRINGE and rinse it out very well 

Biomechanical considerations for the restoration of endodontically treated teeth: a systematic review of th eliterature part ii (dicher doitschi)
- Therefore, in order to establish the best possible adhesion within the root, only specific combinations of dentin adhesives and luting cements proved efficient; presently, total etch adhesives combined with a dual-curing cement appear to be the best choice 
- due to the good adhesion with coronal tissues but reduced adhesion in the deeper canal portions, adhesively luted posts do not need to extend as deeply as posts conventionally cemented

-  just etch on the coronal area not all the way inside
- DO NOT USE ADHESIVE INSIDE THE CANAL!!! 
- use the self-adhesive dual cure cement for cementation of post (Rely-X)

1) Etch coronal surface, 
2) rinse, dry inside canal with paper tips; 
3) use primer
4) 
- Use alcohol on the post, then silane (monobond plus)

for premolar - as long as there is 2-3mm ferulle effect, no post necessary 

Nikton - medium or heavy 

The friction of well-adapted fiber post and cores plays a predominant role in the success of post restoration in endodontically treated teeth 



Comparison between three glass fiber post cementation techniques 

Group A
protocol 1: 
total etch
4th generation (w/ activator)
3 bottles: primer, bonding, activator
Adhesive only works with the activator; use inside of canal
-only dual cure

Group B
protocol 2:
-self-adhesive resin cement 
-dual cure resin cement 

Group C
6th generation
-self-adhesive resin cement 

The role of resin cement on bond strength of glass-fiber posts luted into root canals: a systematic review and meta-analysis of in vitro studies; sarkis-onofre
#journal/prostho 
conclusion: use self-adhesive resin cement could improve the retention of glass-fiber posts 
(many in the market are dual-cure; but also need self-adhesive)

Ferrule: <2mm use post; at least 2mm no need for post 

post selection out of mouth (length of post is 14mm)
- take regular xray, then use the post measuring tool
- need at least 4mm outside of tooth (post sticks out by 4mm)
- need at least 4mm of gutta percha

Clinics - Determining post size
1) Take periapical xray of tooth, using regular film to estimate the size
2) Peeso drill 
3) final drill 
4) try-in, retention test 
5) cementation protocol 

PEESO DRILL - only cuts gutta percha, not tooth structure; there could be peeso drill 1, 2, 3, up to 6; but you might need only 2 drills; 
after drilling to final length with peeso drill, you can use the FINAL DRILL
FINAL DRILL color must match the color of the post. 

Monobond plus is a brand of silane that you can use with all: zirconia, ceramic, metal 

silane = can only use for posts and composite

Tooth:
1. Total etch; 10s
2. rinse 60 s
3. paper points to dry the canal 
4. OptibondFL just for the outside area at most 2mm into the canal; if more the light won't cure 

Post:
1. Clean post with alcohol 
2. Silane,  60s and wait 1 minute 
3. Self-adhesive, dual cure cement  (panavia V5)

Ferrule Effect 
- the maximum length of the build-up can only be x2 length of the ferrule (i.e. if the ferrule is 2mm then the maximum length of the buildup the total length of the buildup + ferrule can only be x2 the length of the ferrule)

# impressions 
- cannot do 2 step technique with custom tray 

SMILE:
you need to bring:
1) phtographies intra/extra oral
2) diagnostic wax up (articulated)
3) articulated models
4) Treatment Plan (whatever you believe) Phase III, IV, V
	1) don't wait for the doctor to give you the solution 
	2) know what materials are going to be used (zr. lithium disilcate, pfm)
	3) know which LAB you're going to send 
	4) Have the pseudo treatment plan budget made (so you can tell the patient; you can have different budgets; for different
**If you don't have it, don't call the patient**

Classification of impression materials 
"amit punj et al. Dental impression materials and techniques"

by Ivoclar (in clinic)
Light body
monophase 
heavy body


Perforated trays - one step/2 step - better for complete denture 
Rim lock: One step/two step - exerts more pressure in the sulcus because the perforated trays will release the pressure ; 

Custom tray - use 1 step; you can also use 1-step technique with regular trays; if you don't need all the information all the way to the vestibule you can cut the custom tray shorter
Custom tray for:
- dental implants (open tray)
- rpd
- rpd with crowns
- torus 

For custom trays, use an adhesive; you can use a cotton ball to spread it or Q-tip

For one-step Technique, you want to have a spacer of about 2mm (and also stoppers! don't forget); after trying it in then adhesive then put heavy body and light body;

for the custom tray, you gonna have at least 2mm so you can do it with monophase;
But for regular trays, you might even have 6mm so you have to fill up that space; so that's why you need to use heavy body in combinatino with light body 

high contact angle, low surface energy; it's like putty 
low contact angle high surface energy; it's like with light body (has ability to copy tissues in greater detail) 

so if you use 1step with putty and light body, it wont work; the putty will push away the light body so that 

if you have a very small sulcus, then you can just use 1 cord; but for most cases, you can use double cord
