Bone Physiology
Compartments:
- Periostium - main cell pop: osteoblasts
- haversion system - concentric lamellae of bone that contain osteocytes
	- osteocytes - retired cells waiting for work if necessary
- Trabecular/spongy bone and endostium - blood vessels, membrane (endostium), main cell pop: osteoclasts
-during bone growth, as in development or growth of children, osteoclasts destroy inner part, and osteoblasts form outer part
-after full growth, there is a normal bone balance 

Bone physiology 
- Normal bone balance 
- Periostium : ARF, ARF, ARF = net gain of bone 
- Haversion systems: ARF, ARF, ARF = equilibrium (no net gain or loss) - this is why haversion systems are always the same size
- Trabecular bone & Endostium : ARF ARF ARF = net loss of bone; because main cell pop is osteoclasts 

osteoclasts come from undifferentiated cells; 

- a stimulus is necessary to activate the normal bone balance - physical activity, trauma, surgery, etc 
Bone turnover: Activation, resorption, formation 

Through the PDL, the stimulus that activates bone turnover is 10-15x more than any other bone in the mandible and maxilla. this is why osteonecrosis related to medication occurs exclusively in the mandible and maxilla.

Postextraction alveolar bone atropohy and remodeling
- without osteoclasts, life is almost impossible 

bisphosphonate: denosumab, zelodronic acid, 
the zelodronic acid - stays for 15 years
denosumab - after withdrawing medication, only stays for 6 months. 

Postextraction alveolar bone atrophy and remodeling 
Tooth extraction day 1 - no fibrin yet, just a big blood clot 
Tooth extraction day 1 to 3 weeks - white patch is fibrin; do not touch it; necessary for reparing and remodeling of bone 

Postextraction alveolar bone atrophy and remodeling 
local factors
	- disuse atrophy 
		- root (periodontal) area: propioception, bleeding and bone formation area
		- implants do not have PDL; teeth have PDL - when pressure is exerted ont he teeth the body detects the force through the PDL. 
		- pressure = bone resorption; tension is bone formation 
		- once you remove a tooth, alveolar bone is unnecessary 
		- after tooth extraction, 6mm resorption in anterior height of edentulous mandibular alveolar ridge after 3 years; 
		- tooth resorption is most intense after 2 years, then gets slower.
	- pressure atrophy 
		- think orthodontics; on the compression side you have bone resorption through the activation of osteoclasts; on the tension side there'll be bone formation through the activation of osteoblasts. 
	- reason of teeth extraction or loss 
		- if you remove a tooth due to periodontal disease, theres already bone resorption; you also are doing an extraction in the presence of chronic inflammation, which means more bone resorptive activity 
		- if you remove a tooth due to caries, there wont be as much bone resorption and inflammation 
		- this is why you want to clean the teeth before extractions. 
	- dental extraction technique without alveolar crest preservation protocol 
		- with the least amount of trauma as possible
	- bone grafts preserve bone volume and width?; volume more important than heightee
	- post extraction healing process after tooth extraction, with/without bone resorption
		- pre extraction 
		- granulation tissue
	- Post extraction alveolar bone atrophy and remodeling; immediate denture
		- immediate dentures destroy more bone contrary to the popular belief that it will stimulate bone formation 
	- denture use habits and parafunctional habits 
		- why you shouldnt wear dentures while you sleep 
		- patient may suffer from bruxism 
	- Diet consistency 
		- masticatory efficiency of dentures is 20% 
		- with implants maybe 40-50% masticatory efficiency 
	- Facial Biotype 
		- which has more problems with bone atrophy?
		- a shorter face will have more problems because the short face has less alveolar crest height 
		- dolliocephalic - in long face; the height of alveolar crest is larger 
systemic factors - primary or senile [[Osteoporosis]] postmenopausal osteoporiss 
- secondary osteoporosis to: chronic renal failure, chronic ...
- Primary or Senile osteoporosis 
	- is a bone disease that develops when bone mineral density and bone mass decreases, and the quality bone changes. this can lead to a decrease in bone strength that can increase the risk of fractures 
	- in 60s for male; after menopause for females. 
	- osteoarthroses is normal part of aging                                                       
	- compression fractures result in deformation and shrinking of the vertebrae and thus height of old people 
	- nowadays, due to bisphosphonates, there are atypical fractures that occur in the middle of the femur rather than closer to the hip
	- osteopenia is between normal and osteoporosis 
		- osteopenia is a pre-pathological condition 
		- treated with calcium, diet, and exercise NOT with bisphosphonates 
- SEcondary [[Osteoporosis]] 
		- due to hyperparathyroidsm for example 
- Quality of diet
	- a systematic review on impact of edentulism on nutritional status of elderly adults as compared to dentulouss adults: edentulism and nutritional status 
	- conclusion: there is good quality evidence that edentulism is associated with poor diet and comporomised nutrition 
	- however, more longitudinal studies on this topic are required to further understand the potential role of nutrition in the prevention of age related changes and reduce the failure of complete denture treatment in elderly adults 
	- nutrient intake and GI problems

- EDENTULOUS MAXILLA AND mandible, anatomical changes 
- maxillary and mandibular anatomical changes 
	- Maxillo-mandibular PA and transverse relationship
- Mandible: alveolar bone, genial process, mental foramen milohyoid and external oblique ridge 
	- in the lower anterior area, during extreme resorption, the genial process becomes prominent 
	- in the premolar area, the mylohyoid line and external oblique ridge, muscle attachment areas, 
	- also, the mental foramen may change anatomical positions from lateral to on top of the ridge, which may cause nerve impingement resulting in pain or paresthesia of the lip 
	- in the molar area, the ian may become also displaced on top of the ridge, causing similar condition as above 
- Maxillar: anterior nasal spine, malar process, incisive foramen, maxillo-mandibular relationship 
	- exposure of incisive foramen
- Postextraction alveolar bone atrophy and remodeling 
	- commissures fall down, lower third vertical face reduced (loss of VD), wrinkles of upper lip due to hypertonic activity of muscle, class iii profile, chronic ulcers due to accumulation of saliva and thus chronic humiditiy; intraorally, there is loss of vestibular height, flabby tissue, epulis fissuratum, 
	- all need pano, cbct, cephalometric; repeat cbct and cephalometric every 3 years to monitor bone loss - nutritional advice, etc. 
- Diagnosis: intraoral analysis, cast analysis 
- Alveolar bone crest preservation  
	- put graft in socket immediately after extraction; preserve the volume (b-l / b-p dimension) and if possible the height 
	- prevent excessively wide expansion movements
		- prioritize rotation movements in upper anteriors 
	- prevent poxt extraction cortical compression 
	- do curettage of reactive periapical lesions (granuloma)
	- consider bone grafting and primary closure of wound 
	- periotome or physics forceps (?.... may deform the plate)
	- bone grafting
	- osteogenic (best; but problem is u have to do another surgery so you can take bone from another part of patient), osteoconductive, or osteoinductive materials?
		- bone graft coming from bottles is osteoconductive or osteoinductive?
	- implant placement and bone grafting
	- implant placement bone graft and membrane
	- osteointegration: ability to bond chemically to bone surface with no fibrous tissue in between 
		- what happens in implants 
		- there is union between metal (titanium) and bone 
		- osteoconduction: ability to support surface bone growth 
		- osteoinduction: ability to promote pluripotential stem cells to differentiate 
		- osteogenesis*: ability to form new bone from osteoblastic cells 
	- After placing a bone graft and waiting 3 months, you can test if the bone has formed by piercing through with a needle;
- Alveolar Bone crest reconstruction 

Dental extractions and implants 
- Dental proximators (periotomes), luxating elevators 
- in molars, the bucco-lingual movement wont really expand the buccal and palatal plates 
- in anteriors, the buccal plate will expand (b/c its thinnner) 
- 

- for upper anteriors, there is a tendencuy for upper anteriors
does implants stop bone resorption? no, bone resorption continues; but the bone resorption becomes less intense

Cole's fracture 
- when an old lady falls, and you stop your fall with your hands, the fracture occurs around the wrist 

18/9/24

Implant lecture day 2

low speed no more than 1600 rpm
- goal is to produce the least heat as possible 

After osteotomy is completed, then place implant at 20/30rpm with low speed 
Place screw, suture flap. 
wait for for osteointegration; union between bone and metal. 

incision, expose cover screw, substitute with healing abutment.  

Osteointegration times:
Anterior mandible: 3 months/ 12 weeks 
Posterior mandible: 3-6 months / 12 weeks
Maxilla: 6-12 months / 12 weeks 
- but in actual practice, it depends on certain factors:
1. Gender 
	1. after menopause, females may suffer from osteopenia/osteoporosis 
	2. male mastication forces are greater 
2. General Health 
	1. osteoporosis/osteopenia? - wait time is doubled; prognosis is lower
3. Age 

Standard lasting time of implants: 10 years in mandible; 5 years in maxilla 

Graft - when you take tissue from donor area to receptor area 
- most common grafting procedure is blood transfustion 
- coming from same individual - autograft 

Implant - non-organic material placed in the body
- most comomn: composite 
- also gutta percha 

Transplant - moving an organ from a donor to the receptor 

Internal hex, basic implant placement resqeucne
1. drilling (osteotomies) - low speed (<1600 rpm)
2. implant placement 
3. cover screw
4. removal of cover screw after complete osteointegration 
5. healing screw - for emergence profile 
6. abutment 

Definitions:
1. Abutment:
	1. a) component(s) above the neck of the implant that serves to support and or retain the prosthesis 
2. acid etched implant (surface))
	2. plasma spray, sanblasted, acid-etched
	3. purpose: provide better primary stability (frictional)
	4. Secondary stability: has to do with union of bone and metal
3. abutment screw 
	1. a screw used to secure the prosthetic abutment to the implant 
	2. crown ideally should be screwed to the abutment instead of cemented
4. allograft 
	1. tissue transplanted between members of the same species
5. Analog
	1. replica of an implant incorporated iwthin a cast for a prostehtic reconstruction int he library 
6. anti-rotational component:
	1. a component of th eimplant body (hexagonal, tapered (morse) or within other internal design, placed to prevent prosthetic abutment rotation)

implants designed by dr. branemark
- broke the legs of the rabbit and put a camera inside to view healing of fractures 
- realized that titanium screws used to put cameras inside, were fully integrated 
- proposed research to do implant-retained dentures
- research rejected
- 2 professors along with branemark went back to his lab and did the research themselves 
- published research in a plastic surgery journal, since his implants were rejected 
- designed external hex abutments (since hew as thinking as an orthopedist not as a dentist - so crown rotation wasn't on his mind)
- but internal hex design is better 

7. autogenous graft (autograft, autologous graft):
	1. tissue taken from one site and place to another site in the same individual 
	2. these bones have cells 

8. Bending stress:
	1. refers to stress forces caused by a load that tends to bend an object (implant)
	2. that's why a nightguard is recommended after implant placement 
9. Bioactive:
	1. having an effect on, or eliciting a response from, living tissue 
	2. titanium the only material to demonstrate this property: interacts with gingiva and bone tissue 
10. Bioactive fixation:
	1. fixation or stabilization which involves the direct physical or chemical attachment mechanisms between biological materials and an implant surface 
11. Biocompatible
	1. ability of a material to function without a negative host response 
	2. silicon, gold, tendon prosthesis, knee, hip rosthesis (metal), cardiac valve
12. Bone allograft: - frozen, freeze-dried bone allograft (FDBA) and demineralized freeze-dried bone allograft (DFDBA) same species 
	1. allograft: human to human - osteogenic
	2. isograft: genes between are the same so graft between those individuals - osteoinductive 
	3. autograft: within individual - osteoinductive 
	4. xenograft: graft between different species 

osteoconduction: a scaffold; slower than osteogenesis and osteoinduction 
13. Bone matrix:
	1. the intercellular element of bone (collagen fibers 35%, inorganic salts Ca 65%; in older patients collagen fibers are lower and Ca is higher)
14. Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP):
	1. osteogenic protein produced by osteoblasts and stored in bone, capable of causing growth in nonosseous tissues (osteoinduction) 
15. Bone quality: - assessment of bone based on its density (osteodensitomtery) 

Multiple implant placement sites
-implants should be place in a straight line
- if you place implants in a curved fashion, there'll be bending, the implants will be damaged

Wax ups are important for stents and for implant placement sites 

16. CAD/CAM: Computed-aided design/ computer-aided manufacturing 
17. cemented prosthesis: a restoration cemented on prosthetic abutments 

Dr. William Osler: three keys for a good medical practice: diagnosis x 3

Complications in third molar extractions and its management 
diagnosis, treatment plan, treatment 

19. computed axial tomography (CT scanning):
	1. a software-assisted radiographic technique that produces an exact cross-sectional view of an specific part of the body 
20. cone beam computed tomography (CBCT)
	1. a ct scanner that uses a cone-shaped radiographic source and large detector to produce a three dimnsional radiographic image of skull and facial skeleton. 
21. cone beam computed tomography (CBCT)
	1. a ct scanner that uses a cone-shaped radiographic source and large detector to produce a three dimensional radiographic image of skull and facial skeleton. 

CBCT - isotropic voxels - no distortion 
in CAT - there is distortion in the sagittal plane? 

Hounsfield CBCT - the guy that came up with the formula used in CBCT to calculate density of tissues, which you can measure using tools in a CBCT viewer

radiolucent/radiopaque does not exist in radiology (only in dental readiology); it is called hypodense/hyperdense

Bone Type 1
- comparable with cedar wood which is very dense and hard (b/w mental foramens)
- anterior mandible best place to place implants 12 week osseointegration process 
Bone Type 2
- comparable to pine wood, which is not as hard as cedar 
- posterior mandible 
Bone Type 3
- balsa wood which is not hard nor as dense as bone type II
- for airplane models
Bone type 4
- Type IV bone is like styrofoam 
- upper maxilla posterior 

Implant placement without surgical stent 
- measure existing teeth molar then place it where the edentulous area is where you want on the opposite side, then put implant in the center of it 
- see picture 

Implant placement with surgical semirestrictve stent (plastic, initial drill)

- see picture (surgery: drilling sequence in bone type I to insert a 4.0 implant)
- crestal tap - use drill only once 

type IV - transform type IV to type III using the osteotomes 

Flapless single implant placement wiht totally restrictive surgical guide 

- never raise a lingual flap because there is no attached gingiva and you may need a gingival graft; worse place to place flap is in posterior mandible 
- worse place to place implant is 2nd molar position in mandible and maxilla 

1st: pilot drill 
2nd: parallel pins - check inclination m-d and b-p; and occlusion 
3rd next
final drill: 
countersink drill - the platform is wider than implant diameter 
Bone tap (optional) for bone type I 
implant placement with contrangle or manual ratchet - 10 to 20 rpm; abundant irrigation 

Implants: complications:
successful criteria:
1. implant clinically imboile
2. no periimplant radiolucid line
3. vertical bone loss less than 0.2 mm yearly (implant placement does not stop bone loss but makes it very slow)
4. Absence of pain, infection, paresthesia, transgingival and or nasal secretion 
5. 85% success at 5 years and 80% at 10 years (hygiene, yearly or biannual dental visits)

Implants Quality scale:
I. optimal health 
tx: routine maintenance 

II. satisfactory health (this is implant survival)

In old patients, the risk with bone surgery is a fat embolism from the bone marrow 

Ideal donor area of bone: Anterior iliac crest.- contains a lof of osteogenic cells; disadvantages - demands general anesthesia; (also with posterior iliac crest)
Tibia - you can gather - bone with local and sedation 
Calvaria
Chin + tibia = most common donor sites 

articaine - only anesthetic colution capable of penetrating the cortical plate well, unlike lidocaine 
in the chin, you will work between the mental foramens for chin donor sites; osteotomy is 3-4mm below apices.


bone type i or ii - you can correct the inclination with the 2nd or 3rd 
bone type Iii or IV - can't correct angulation b/c you dont need as many burs (osteotomy doesn't need to be as wide as in i or ii)
